/**
 * What the app was doing, written down while it does it.
 *
 * This is phase zero of the rebuild and it is built before the camera on
 * purpose. The previous attempt ran ten versions without a working log, and
 * every one of those versions was a guess that cost an hour of testing on the
 * phone. Rotation and white balance took six attempts each for the same
 * reason: the app was built before there was any way of seeing what it was
 * doing.
 *
 * Four decisions here, each of which is the fix for something that went wrong.
 *
 * The file goes in getExternalFilesDir. That needs no permission, cannot be
 * refused by the person or the system, and lands somewhere reachable in any
 * file manager under Android/data/com.mantraproductions.ndi/files.
 *
 * Nothing is buffered. A BufferedWriter holds the last few kilobytes in memory
 * and those are exactly the lines that say what the app was doing when it
 * died. Every line is a write straight to the descriptor; the kernel keeps it
 * even if the process is killed a microsecond later. It costs one syscall per
 * line, which is affordable for startup steps and for a fader being dragged,
 * and is NOT affordable per video frame. Nothing on the camera callback thread
 * may call this.
 *
 * Nothing here may throw. A logger that can crash the app turns every fault
 * into two faults and hides the first. Every entry point catches Throwable and
 * gives up quietly.
 *
 * Lines written before the file is open are kept and flushed into it. The
 * earliest steps are the ones worth having, and they happen before there is a
 * Context to ask for a directory.
