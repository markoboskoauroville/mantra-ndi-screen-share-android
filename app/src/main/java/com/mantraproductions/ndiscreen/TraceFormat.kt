 * The shape of every line the app writes about itself.
 *
 * This file imports nothing from Android on purpose, so the whole of it runs
 * on a desk in a second. The previous build shipped ten versions with no
 * readable trace, and every one of those versions was a guess; the way that
 * does not happen again is that the part of the trace which can be wrong
 * (the clock, the columns, the filenames) is arithmetic, and arithmetic can
 * be held to account by a test.
 *
 * Two rules are baked in here rather than left to the caller.
 *
 * No java.util.Formatter and no String.format anywhere below. Those read the
 * default locale, so a phone set to Croatian writes 1,5 MB and +0,412 while
 * the desk that tested it writes 1.5 MB and +0.412. A trace whose numbers
 * change shape depending on the phone's language is a trace that cannot be
 * grepped. Everything here is integer arithmetic and padding.
 *
 * Fixed column widths, because the file is read on a phone screen. A trace
 * whose columns do not line up is read as prose, and prose is not scanned.
