/**
 * What killed the app, written down before it finishes dying.
 *
 * Two things here are the fix for two separate faults in the last build.
 *
 * The handler takes a Throwable, and everything inside it catches Throwable.
 * A rejected GL shader arrives as an Error, not an Exception, and an Error
 * walks straight past a catch on Exception as though nothing had been written
 * at all. Java's own uncaught handler hands over a Throwable for exactly this
 * reason; the mistake is narrowing it afterwards.
 *
 * The report is written in two places, in that order. First into the app's own
 * external files directory, which needs no permission and cannot be refused.
 * Then into Downloads through MediaStore, which is reachable without a file
 * manager that can see Android/data. The order matters: the guaranteed copy is
 * written before the convenient one, so a failure in the second never costs
 * the first.
 *
 * And the previous handler is always called afterwards. Swallowing the
 * throwable leaves a process with a dead UI thread and no dialogue, which
 * looks to a person like the app froze rather than crashed.
